# Sorting-Algorithms

Sorting is arranging a collection of elements or data in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order based on the elements' values. Sorting is a fundamental operation in programming used to organize data for various purposes, such as searching, reporting, and data analysis. Sorting can be applied to various data structures, including arrays and lists, and can be performed using built-in methods or custom sorting logic. Sorting ensures that data is ordered and accessible in a structured manner, making it easier to work with and process.
