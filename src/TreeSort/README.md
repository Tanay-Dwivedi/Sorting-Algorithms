#  Tree Sort
-----

## Definition:-

Tree Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds a binary search tree (BST) from the elements of the input array. It then performs an in-order traversal of the BST, which results in the sorted order of elements. This algorithm utilizes the property of BSTs, where the in-order traversal of a BST produces sorted elements.

-----

## Time Complexity Analysis:-

The time complexity of Tree Sort is O(n log n) in the average case and O(n^2) in the worst case when the tree is unbalanced. This is because the insertion of each element into the binary search tree (BST) takes O(log n) time on average, and the in-order traversal takes O(n) time. However, if the tree is highly unbalanced, such as in the case of inserting elements in sorted order, the time complexity can degrade to O(n^2) due to the skewed tree structure.

-----

## Space Complexity Analysis:-

The space complexity of Tree Sort is O(n) as it requires additional space to store the binary search tree (BST) structure. This space is proportional to the number of elements in the input array. Additionally, the recursive calls during insertion and traversal consume stack space, but the overall space usage remains O(n) for storing the tree and the input array.

-----

## Advantages:-

1. **Efficient for Large Data Sets:** Tree Sort is efficient for sorting large data sets as it has an average time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for handling large amounts of data.
  
2. **Stable Sorting:** It preserves the order of equal elements, making it a stable sorting algorithm. This property is important in certain applications where the original order of equal elements needs to be maintained.

3. **Adaptive Nature:** Tree Sort's performance adapts well to the distribution of input data. Unlike some other sorting algorithms, Tree Sort's time complexity can improve if the input data is nearly sorted or partially sorted, resulting in faster sorting times in such cases.

----

## Dis-advantages:-

1. **Space Complexity:** Tree Sort uses additional memory for the binary search tree (BST), increasing space requirements.
   
2. **Unbalanced Trees:** Performance may degrade if the BST becomes highly unbalanced, potentially leading to O(n^2) time complexity.
   
3. **Non-Adaptive:** Tree Sort's time complexity doesn't adjust to input data, resulting in suboptimal performance for partially sorted inputs.

-----

## Uses:-

1. **Sorting elements in a Binary Search Tree (BST):** Utilizing Tree Sort to organize data within a binary search tree structure.

2. **Real-time Systems:** Employing Tree Sort in systems with memory constraints that permit tree-based structures for sorting.

3. **Database Management Systems (DBMS):** Implementing Tree Sort for maintaining sorted data dynamically, a common requirement in DBMS.

4. **Preparing for Tree-based Algorithms:** Utilizing Tree Sort to arrange data for algorithms like binary search, which operate efficiently on sorted data.

5. **Educational Purposes:** Tree Sort serves as an educational tool to illustrate binary search trees and sorting algorithms in computer science curricula.

## Explanation of how the code works:

```java
class Node {
    int key;
    Node left, right;

    public Node(int item) {
        key = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
```
This block of code defines a class named `Node`, which represents a node in a binary search tree (BST). Each node contains a `key` (an integer value) and references to its left and right children. The constructor initializes a node with the given `item` as its key.

```java
public class TreeSort {
    Node root;

    public TreeSort() {
        root = null;
    }
```
This block defines a public class named `TreeSort`, which represents a binary search tree data structure. It contains a reference to the root node of the tree. The constructor initializes an empty tree by setting the root to `null`.

```java
    // Function to insert a new key into the BST
    public void insert(int key) {
        root = insertRec(root, key);
    }
```
This method `insert` is used to insert a new key into the binary search tree. It delegates the insertion process to a recursive helper method `insertRec`.

```java
    // A recursive function to insert a new key in BST
    private Node insertRec(Node root, int key) {
        if (root == null) {
            root = new Node(key);
            return root;
        }

        if (key < root.key) {
            root.left = insertRec(root.left, key);
        } else if (key > root.key) {
            root.right = insertRec(root.right, key);
        }

        return root;
    }
```
This private method `insertRec` is a recursive helper function to insert a new key into the binary search tree. It traverses the tree recursively based on the comparison of the `key` with the current node's key (`root.key`) and inserts the new node at the appropriate position.

```java
    // Perform in-order traversal of the BST
    public void inOrder(Node root, int[] arr, int[] index) {
        if (root != null) {
            inOrder(root.left, arr, index);
            arr[index[0]++] = root.key;
            inOrder(root.right, arr, index);
        }
    }
```
This method `inOrder` performs an in-order traversal of the binary search tree. It recursively visits the nodes in the left subtree, processes the current node, and then recursively visits the nodes in the right subtree. During the traversal, it stores the keys of the nodes in the array `arr` and updates the index accordingly.

```java
    public static void treeSort(int[] arr) {
        TreeSort treeSort = new TreeSort();
        for (int num : arr) {
            treeSort.insert(num);
        }

        int[] index = {0};
        treeSort.inOrder(treeSort.root, arr, index);
    }
```
This static method `treeSort` is the entry point for performing tree sort. It creates an instance of the `TreeSort` class, inserts each element of the input array into the binary search tree, and then performs an in-order traversal to retrieve the elements in sorted order.

This completes the breakdown of the provided Java code for tree sort.
